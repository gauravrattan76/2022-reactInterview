 Can web browsers read JSX directly? 
* Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object 
* For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel
