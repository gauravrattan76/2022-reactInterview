JSX-
__________________


What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.


render(){
return(
<div>JSX Code here</div>
)}




 Can web browsers read JSX directly? 
* Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object 
* For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel



So we have to use babel transpolar
